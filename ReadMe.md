# 🚀 Scrummer OS
### Delivery Intelligence & Ceremony Copilot

**Scrummer OS** is a premium, privacy-first Agile dashboard that converts raw sprint data into actionable risk signals. Designed with a **Modern Joy** aesthetic, it helps teams identify slippage, manage capacity, and run smarter ceremonies without the need for a database.

---

## 🎨 Preview & Aesthetic
Scrummer OS utilizes a **Material 3 Hybrid** design system. It features:
* **Glassmorphic Main Canvas:** Airy, elevated surfaces for data clarity.
* **Floating Sidebar:** Quick navigation through the 3-step delivery flow.
* **Premium Typography:** Powered by *Plus Jakarta Sans* for a modern, geometric feel.



---

## 🛠️ The 3-Step Intelligence Flow

1.  **Launchpad:** Initialize your sprint. Enter team size, availability, and historical velocity.
2.  **Intelligence:** View your **Risk Score (0-100)** and **Delivery Confidence**. Scrummer identifies "Risky Drivers" like scope creep or capacity shortfalls automatically.
3.  **Actions:** Get specific, context-aware suggestions to protect your sprint goal.



---

## 🤖 AI Ceremony Copilot
The **Copilot** is a dedicated workspace for your Agile rituals:
* **Daily Standup:** Identifies focus issues and blockers.
* **Planning:** Validates commitment vs. historical reality.
* **Retro:** Analyzes volatility to suggest the best process experiment.

## 🧮 The Math (Scrummer Engine)

Scrummer uses a deterministic risk model:

* **Scope Pressure:** `Committed Points / Avg Velocity`
* **Capacity Health:** `(Ideal Capacity - Leave) / Committed Points`
* **Volatility:** `Standard Deviation / Mean Velocity`
